AMD Radeon ProRender USD Hydra delegate
===========================

This plugin allows fast GPU or CPU accelerated viewport rendering on all OpenCL 1.2 hardware for the open source USD and Hydra system

You can build this plugin as usdview plugin or as houdini plugin.

For more details on USD, please visit the web site [here](http://openusd.org).

Prerequisites
-----------------------------

#### Common
* **AMD Radeon™ ProRender SDK** [link](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/sdk-agreement)
* **AMD Radeon™ Image Filter Library** [link](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/sdk-agreement)
License allows non-commercial use for developers.  Contact through the website for commercial distribution.

#### For UsdView plugin
* **USD build / tree**
As many USD users get the USD libraries from different places, or compile their own, we tried to keep this as flexible as possible.
You can download USD to build yourself from [GitHub](https://www.github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD)

#### For Houdini plugin
* **Houdini 18**
You can download Houdini installer from [Daily Builds | SideFX](https://www.sidefx.com/download/daily-builds/#category-gold)

Building
-----------------------------

Build using cmake.

| RPR_LOCATION               | Radeon Pro Render directory with include and lib dirs                   | 1.35.0 or higher |

##### Radeon Image Filters

| Dependency Name            | Description                                                             | Version          |
| ------------------         |-----------------------------------------------------------------------  | -------          |
| RIF_LOCATION               | Radeon Image Filter Library directory with include and lib dirs         | 1.4.2 or higher  |

##### UsdView plugin Components

UsdView plugin is build by default (```RPR_BUILD_AS_HOUDINI_PLUGIN=FALSE```).

| Dependency Name            | Description                                                             | Version          |
| ------------------         |-----------------------------------------------------------------------  | -------          |
| USD_ROOT                   | USD directory with include and lib dirs                                 | 19.11            |

##### Houdini plugin Components

To build houdini plugin set cmake flag ```RPR_BUILD_AS_HOUDINI_PLUGIN=TRUE```. `HOUDINI_ROOT` is the directory containing the `houdini_setup` file.

| Dependency Name            | Description                                                             | Version          |
| ------------------         |-----------------------------------------------------------------------  | -------          |
| HOUDINI_ROOT               | Houdini toolkit directory                                               | 18               |

#### Optional Components

##### OpenVDB

Support for OpenVDB is disabled by default, and can optionally be enabled by
specifying the cmake flag ```RPR_ENABLE_OPENVDB_SUPPORT=TRUE```.

**Following dependency required only for usdview plugin, houdini is shipped with own build of openvdb**

| Dependency Name            | Description                                                             | Version          |
| ------------------         |-----------------------------------------------------------------------  | -------          |
| OPENVDB_LOCATION           | OpenVDB directory with include and lib dirs                             |                  |

#### Utility cmake options

##### `RPR_SDK_PLATFORM` - Forcing build against specific platform libraries

Let's say you are on centos 7 and want to force it to use the centos6 build,
then you need to specify ```RPR_SDK_PLATFORM=centos6``` cmake flag

#### Example

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DUSD_ROOT=/data/usd_build -DRPR_LOCATION=/data/RPR_SDK/RadeonProRender -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/data/usd_build ..
make
make install
```

Supported Platforms
-----------------------------
* Windows
* linux(experimental)
* macOS(experimental)

Try it out
-----------------------------

Set the environment variables specified by the script when it finishes and
launch ```usdview``` with a sample asset.

```
> usdview extras/usd/tutorials/convertingLayerFormats/Sphere.usda
```

And select RPR as the render delegate.

#### Environment Variables

*   `PXR_PLUGINPATH_NAME`

    If you want the RPR menu added to USDView (allows selecting device, and render quality). Set it to ``` PXR_PLUGINPATH_NAME=${USD_ROOT}/lib/python/rpr ```, where USD_ROOT is your USD install directory.

*   `RPR_ENABLE_TRACING`

    Instruct Radeon ProRender to generate trace files for debugging purposes. The tracing will record all RPR commands with a memory dump of the data used. By default, RPR tracing is disabled. To enable it set `RPR_ENABLE_TRACING` to 1.

    When tracing is enabled, the trace files are recorded by default in the following directory depending on the OS (In the case of multiple directories first existing will be used):

    - `C:\ProgramData\hdRPR` for Windows
    - `$TMPDIR/hdRPR`, `$P_tmpdir/hdRPR`, `/tmp/hdRPR` for Linux and macOS

*   `RPR_TRACING_PATH`

    To change the default directory, add the environment variable `RPR_TRACING_PATH` pointing to the location in which you wish the trace files to be recorded. For example, set `RPR_TRACING_PATH=C:\folder\` to activate the tracing in `C:\folder\`.
